# Selenium basics EXAMPLE project

## A small and simple project to teach myself the basics of Selenium

This project was done with the end goal of teaching myself how to perform testing/automation in Python. These are all the resources:
* Used http://demo.seleniumeasy.com/basic-first-form-demo.html as the practice website
* Imported Selenium
* Imported the webdriver module for my web browser (chrome)
