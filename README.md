# Selenium basics EXAMPLE project

## A small and simple project to teach myself the basics of Selenium

This project was done with the end goal of teaching myself how to perform testing/automation in Python. To do this, I used Selenium and used this dummy website: http://demo.seleniumeasy.com/basic-first-form-demo.html
